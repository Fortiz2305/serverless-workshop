# Module 1: Web Hosting using Amazon S3

In this module we are going to deploy a static web, using Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) as host. Firstly, we are going to solve the problem using the [Serverless](https://serverless.com/) framework. If you are already comfortable working with the AWS console and you don't want to use the framework "magic", you can go to the [Not using Serverless Framework](#not-using-serverless-framework) section.
